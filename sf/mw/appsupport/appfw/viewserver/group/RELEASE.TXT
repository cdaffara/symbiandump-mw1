Version 
===================
Made by Mark Donohoe 2/11/99

Migration of the Roxette 005 ViewSrv release to the Uikon 1.2 project.

1. Added unit test code TVWS0 which exercises the public API of the server
   To start test shell copy WSINI.INI and DLL_LIST.TXT to z\system\data.
2. Added UikonDoc comments for classes and public methods

The View Architecture
--------------------- 

In a typical Eikon application, the user will be presented with a number of different views on the applications
data (e.g. inbox and outbox in a messaging app). Currently views are organised on an ad-hoc basis by each
application. The view architecture, which was introduced in the Roxette project, makes the views part of the
application framework. It offers the following functionality

 App switching capability
 Automatic save of data
 Resource management
 Message passing interface
 Support for standard view controls
 Exception handling
 
A typical use case for the view architecture is as follows - User looks up contact and switches to mail editor
1. The user looks up a contact in the address book.
2. The user selects a direct navigational link to go the mail editor
3. The system switches view to the mail editor with the contact address automatically supplied

Viewsrv component
-----------------

The Viewsrv component provides a view switching client-server architecture.

A view is represented in the server by the TVwsViewId class which encapsulates two UIds - one for the
application associated with the view and another for the view itself. Each application participating in
the view switching does so in three ways

1. It creates a client session, adds its views to the server maintained list when it starts up and removes
   them when it shuts down.
2. It can then request that any view in the system be activated through its client session. The server will
   queue the requests it gets and process them in turn. If a view has not been registered in the server when an
   activation request arrives, the server will try to start the application associated with that view through the
   MVwsAppStarter interface
3. It implements the MVwsSessionObserver interface to do the real work of view switching. Sessions which own views
   to be activated and deactivated will be called back to handle these events. Applications must therefore maintain
   an outstanding request for asynchronous event notification and handle the TVwsViewEvents passed to them.
