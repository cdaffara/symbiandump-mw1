    \class HbDocumentLoader
    \brief HbDocumentLoader allows applications to construct widget hierarchies from DocML files.
    
    You can load a document using \c HbDocumentLoader::load method. Afther that you can access to
    loaded objects by processing returned objects roots tree, or by using \c findObject / \c findWidget
    methods (\c HbDocumentLoader always keeps references to loaded objects)
     
    \c HbDocumentLoader uses \c HbDocumentLoader::createObject method to retrieve objects. By default, 
    this method creates always new instances based on class name. In addition to basic \c QObject 
    classes provided by Qt, only public widgets of Hb library are supported. Thus, in order to be 
    able to create your own custom widgets, you have to derive from this class and override 
    \c createObject method.

    See \c HbDocumentLoader::createBinary for information about DocML binary conversion
    in build time.

    Use the \c HbDocumentLoaderPlugin to add tool support for custom widgets.
    
    Example code:
    \snippet{documentloadersample.cpp,1}

    For more information about DocML syntax, please refer to S60QtProgrammersGuide.
