\brief Static virtual keyboard host

The virtual keyboard host takes care of keyboard animations.
This version, unlike other vkb host implementations,  only brings up the virtual keyboard but does not
move the underlying view or reposition the editor in case it is fully or partially covered by the virtual
keyboard. In other words, it does not gurantee that the editor cursor remains visible.
That task is left to application developer who chooses to use this vkb host.

This host is meant to be used in those special cases where none of the existing vkb hosts work with the application
in suitable way.
