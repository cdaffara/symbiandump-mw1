    \class HbMainWindow

    \brief HbMainWindow is a GraphicsView instance, which can be initialized with S60
    style decorators.

    HbMainWindow is a specialized version of QGraphicsView. It represents the
    main window of an application. HbMainWindow constructs also HbGraphicsScene,
    which has separate layers where user can place graphics items. HbMainWindow
    constructs three layers which are drawn on top of each other: background
    layer, content layer and decorator layer. The level of depth of graphics
    items is set at the items creation time by setting its parent. To place an
    item on the content level use currentView() function to get content layer.

    Do not call QGraphicsView::setBackgroundBrush() on a HbMainWindow, prefer
    using QGraphicsScene::setBackgroundBrush() instead. By setting the
    background brush for the graphics view certain functionality provided by
    HbGraphicsScene's background drawing code would be lost. Also, the scene's
    background brush is only effective (visible) when the
    Hb::WindowFlagNoBackground flag is set for the HbMainWindow. Normally the
    standard background item fills the entire screen so the background is not
    really visible.

    HbMainWindow has a signalling mechanism for helping control the
    application's view construction. The viewReady() signal is emitted when a
    view's internal construction is completed and basic parts of view are
    already drawn. Same signal is also emitted when current view has
    changed. This helps applications to split the view construction to
    reasonable tasks.  For example the lower priority tasks like opening network
    connection or preparing other currently hidden application views can happen
    on background when first view is already drawn.

    Example of simple Hb application constructing HbMainWindow:

    \include mainwindow1/main.cpp

    Example of adding stock widgets to HbMainWindow:

    \include mainwindow2/main.cpp

    Following example has a linear layout set to a widget, which is then added
    to the HbMainWindow. Layout contains two widgets HbLabel and HbPushButton.

    \include mainwindow3/main.cpp

    More examples can be found from HbView class.

    \sa HbView, Hb::ZValues, Hb::WindowFlags

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::aboutToChangeOrientation()

    This signal is emitted when the orientation change starts.
 */

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::aboutToChangeOrientation(Qt::Orientation newOrientation, bool animated)

    This signal is emitted when the orientation change starts. This version of
    aboutToChangeOrientation also includes the information about the new
    orientation and whether the orientation change is animated or not.  This can
    be used for example by widgets who want to participate in the orientation
    change animation.
 */

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::orientationChanged()

    This signal is emitted when animation related to orientation change has completed.
 */

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::aboutToChangeView(HbView *oldView, HbView *newView)

    This signal is emitted before starting a view change. Note that it is only
    emitted when there is a real view change (i.e. when setCurrentView() is
    used), it will not be emitted when views are added to the main window via
    addView().

    It is guaranteed that this signal is emitted before starting any view switch
    animation.
 */

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::currentViewChanged(HbView *view)

    This signal is emitted when the current view changes. Do not make assumptions about
    the exact timing of this signal, it may be emitted at any time during the view switch
    (this is relevant if the view switch is animated, i.e. it is not guaranteed that the
    signal will be emitted at the end of the animation, in fact it is usually emitted
    already when the animation starts).

    \sa aboutToChangeView()
    \sa viewReady()
 */

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::viewReady()

    This signal is emitted first time when window content is drawn on screen.
    It will only be emitted again when current view is changed and drawn on screen.

    This means that this signal is emitted in the following cases:

    - When the mainwindow is fully constructed, this happens shortly after
      painting it for the first time.

    - When a new view is added using addView() or insertView() after the
      mainwindow is fully constructed and the newly added view becomes the
      current view. It will not be emitted when calling addView() or
      insertView() before showing the mainwindow or entering the event loop
      because in that case the signal will anyway be emitted later, when the
      mainwindow becomes ready. It is also not emitted when the newly added view
      does not become the current view.

    - When the current view is changed using setCurrentView().

    If the view switch is animated, the signal is emitted only after the effect has
    completed.

    Application developers may connect to this signal to do lower priority construction
    tasks. Note however that when thinking about the tasks, it is important to keep the UI
    responsive all the time.
 */

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::obscured()

    This signal is emited whenever the window is completely overlaped by another
    window.

    Application developers can use this signal to pause or stop painting when
    the window is not visible to the user at all.

    This signal has real implementation only for Symbian and X11 platforms. On
    desktop platforms it is simulated via a settings window option.

    The typical use case is to use the obscured() and revealed() signals in
    connection with device dialogs (global pop-ups): When such a dialog is
    shown, the application loses foreground (focus), but it may still be
    partially visible because the dialogs will not fill the entire screen. To
    get notified about such cases, combine your application's
    foreground-background handling with handling also these signals.

    Consider this as a best-effort solution only, the exact behavior depends on
    the platform and may have limitations. For example on Symbian transparent
    windows will never obscure another window, regardless of the content.

    These signals are not a replacement to the focus-based ApplicationActivate
    and ApplicationDeactivate events. An application may lose the focus
    completely (i.e. lose foreground) even when it is still partially visible to
    the user.

/*!
    \fn void HbMainWindow::revealed()

    This signal is emited whenever the window is visible to the user partially
    or completely.

    desktop platforms it is simulated via the settings option.

    Consider this as a best-effort solution only, the exact behavior depends on

    windows may cause the revealed signal to be emitted even when the content is
    not really visible.

    These signals are not a replacement to the focus-based ApplicationActivate

/*!
    Adds a \a widget to the HbMainWindow object. Passing 0 in
    \a widget creates an empty HbView.

    The \a widget can be either a HbView or QGraphicsWidget. If it is
    a QGraphicsWidget (or any subclass that is not HbView) then
    HbMainWindow will create a HbView and set \a widget as the new
    HbView's content widget.

    When \a widget is a HbView, use HbView::setWidget() to set the content
    widget for the view. Note that you should never attach child items or set a layout
    directly to the HbView instance, even though HbView is also a HbWidget.
    Instead, create a content widget, set it to the view via HbView::setWidget(),
    and attach children or set a layout to that.

    Use setCurrentView() to switch between the added views. (only one of them is visible at a time)
    The view-specific decorators (toolbar, Options menu, title in the titlebar) and of course
    the visibility of the view's content widgets will be updated and managed automatically by the framework
    when switching views.

    For a detailed description of views see the HbView class.

    Note that using view switching (i.e. several HbView instances, setCurrentView(), etc.) in
    Hb applications is not mandatory, it is purely optional. For applications that are not really
    view based (e.g. because they only have one screen of content or because they have more "fluid" UI where
    the traditional view separation does not make that much sense) it may sometimes be better (and may provide more freedom)
    to have just one view and manage the content entirely via the content widget of that one view.
    (one can still use HbStackedLayout and manual visibility management of child widgets to achieve a traditional view-like look,
    even when the Hb view management is not used)

    After calling addView() the caller does not need to care about
    destroying \a widget, the framework will take care of that by
    reparenting \a widget if needed.

    A HbMainWindow should only have one of each view and adding a view
    it already has will not cause the same view to be in the
    HbMainWindow twice.
