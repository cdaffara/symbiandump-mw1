  \class HbIconAnimator

  \brief HbIconAnimator is the animation interface for animated icons. Class HbIconItem
  uses it for built-in animation support. For more specific use cases, clients can also
  create their own HbIconAnimator instance and use it for driving an icon animation.

  If the icon is not animated, the animator does not do anything.

  The animator provides signals for observing the start, stop and finish of the animation and the
  animation progress.
*/

/*!
  \fn void HbIconAnimator::animationStarted()

  This signal is emitted whenever the icon animation is started from the
  beginning. By default an icon animation is started when the icon is painted
  for the first time. This behaviour can be disabled with the flag
  HbIcon::NoAutoStartAnimation.

  Note that the signal is not emitted when restarting due to
  looping. Also keep in mind that the animation will restart from the
  beginning if the icon properties, e.g. the size are changed. In this
  case the started signal will also be emitted again and this is not
  an error, it is normal.

  \sa startAnimation()
*/

/*!
  \fn void HbIconAnimator::animationStopped()

  This signal is emitted whenever the icon animation is stopped (by calling
  stopAnimation()) before the animation has finished.

  \sa stopAnimation()
*/

/*!
  \fn void HbIconAnimator::animationProgressed()

  This signal is emitted whenever the icon animation has progressed and the
  icon should be repainted to the screen.
*/

/*!
  \fn void HbIconAnimator::animationFinished()

  This signal is emitted whenever the icon animation is finished (and there was
  no stopAnimation() call). This can be used e.g. to synchronize subsequent icon
  animations. If looping is enabled then this signal is never emitted.
