\class HbInputMethod
\brief A base class for input method implementations.

HbInputMethod is the base class for input method implementations. It inherits from QInputContext,
connects to the input framework behind the scenes and resolves correct input state handler when
an editor widget is focused.

An internal framework class called HbInputModeCache scans through the system and looks for
available HbInputMethod instances. It then forms a list of input methods based on language
and keyboard type. Input method plugin reports (as plugin meta-data) which languages,
keyboards and input modes that plugin instance implements. Input mode cache then activates matching
HbInputMethod depending on the editor properties. It switches the active input method on the fly
when the focus switches between editors if the previous input method is unable to
support newly focused editor.

Custom input methods are a special class of input methods. Once a custom input method is
activated from UI, input mode cache stops resolving input methods upon focus operations
and the custom input is active in all editors until it is deactivated.

\bold The input framework program flow

1. An editor gains input focus.<BR>
2. Editor sets requestSoftwareInputPanel event to active input context.<BR>
3. The input framework creates input state based on editor attributes and the input mode cache <BR>
   resolves correct mode handler and activates it.<BR>
4. A virtual function HbInputMethod::focusReceived is called. At this point the input method<BR>
   initializes whatever it needs to initialize in order to start the input operation (for example,<BR>
   opens the virtual keyboard by using HbVkbHost API) and waits for user actions.<BR>
5. Text is written. The input method delivers results to the editor buffer by using HbInputFocusObject API.<BR>
   It can access editor attributes via HbEditorInterface API.<BR>
6. The active editor loses focus. At this point the input method receives a call to virtual function<BR>
   HbInputMethod::focusLost and is expected to conclude any ongoing input operations and shut down active<BR>
   UI elements (such as the virtual keyboard).<BR>
7. The input method waits for next focusReceived() call. <BR>

\bold Input method resolving

The input framework resolves correct input state handler based on three attributes: input mode,
keyboard type and input language.

The framework recognizes three different input modes: default, numeric and custom.
Default and numeric input modes are something that the framework resolves for active
input language and keyboard type. Custom input mode is something that the framework never
activates automatically, but it is activated from UI or directly from application
(or input method) code.

Numeric input mode is something that can handle those editors that are configured to only accept
numeric data (for example those that have Qt::ImhDigitsOnly hints on).

Language attribute is matched either as a direct match or as a language range. Language range
means the input method is capable of handling all the languages that
HbKeymapFactory::availableLanguages() returns. Direct match always wins so it is possible
to override language range for specific languages.

The keyboard attribute is always matched directly. Note that event though the constant
has term "keyboard" in it, it covers all input devices such as hand writing recognition widgets
that don't utilize traditional keys. it is up the the input method what that constant
really means.

The input method resolving parameters are part of input plugin meta data and they are returned
by QInputContextPlugin::languages() method. A single entry in the returned string list
is formed by packing resolving parameters into HbInputModeProperties structure and calling
HbInputModeProperties::asString() method.

Following code snippet shows how the input context plugin returns resolving parameters

\snippet{unittest_hbinputmethod/unittest_hbinputmethod.cpp,1}

\bold Input method resolving example

Say that we have implemented touch input methods for 12 key portrait mode and qwerty landscape mode.
Then we have Chinese touch input method for both portrait and landscape orientations and also
Chinese handwriting recognition input mode for portrait mode.

Touch input methods resolve to language range, which means that they will handle all
the other languages, except Chinese, which has its own designated input method.

Touch input methods also implement support for numeric mode. Because Chinese language uses
same numeric system as "latin" based languages, we only want to implement numeric mode
handling in one input method and arrange resolving parameters so that the numeric mode
is handled by default touch input method even when the global input language is Chinese.

Chinese handwriting input method is something that is a custom mode, and will be activated
from UI.

Following example shows how the resolving attributes are set up to achieve above configuration.

Portait touch input method returns following attributes

\snippet{unittest_hbinputmethod/unittest_hbinputmethod.cpp,2}

Landscape touch input method returns following attributes

\snippet{unittest_hbinputmethod/unittest_hbinputmethod.cpp,3}

Chinese portrait input method returns following attributes

\snippet{unittest_hbinputmethod/unittest_hbinputmethod.cpp,4}

Chinese landscape input method returns following attributes

\snippet{unittest_hbinputmethod/unittest_hbinputmethod.cpp,5}

Chinese handwriting recognition input method returns following attributes
(note use of HbInputModeCustom, in this example HWR is something that we
want to active from UI separately).
